# TODO List for Refining Image Processing System

## Backend Changes
- [x] Modify `/process` endpoint in `backend/app.py` to return both original and processed images as base64.

## Frontend Design Updates
- [x] Update `frontend/index.html` to use CSS classes from `style.css` for modern, responsive design.
- [x] Restructure HTML with proper containers, control panel, and preview sections.

## Frontend Functionality Updates
- [x] Update `frontend/renderer.js` to:
  - Convert original images to base64.
  - Store both original and processed base64 in `processedImages` array.
  - Update PDF generation to include both original and processed images side by side.
  - Add loading indicators during processing.
  - Improve error handling and UX.

## Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test the updated system for image processing and PDF generation.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Verify download functionality for images and PDF.
